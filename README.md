# Mineral-Mapping

## Objective
This project involves mineral mapping using hyperspectral remote sensing data from the Astral Satellite Hyperion dataset. The objective is to explore and compare traditional band ratio methods and machine learning-based clustering techniques for identifying and mapping mineral distributions.

## Methodologies

1. Traditional Band Ratio Method

    * Radiometric Calibration: Adjusting the sensor response to true reflectance values.
    
    * Atmospheric Calibration: Correcting for atmospheric distortions.
    
    * Mosaicking: Combining multiple images to create a seamless hyperspectral dataset.
    
    * ENVI Software: Processing and analyzing hyperspectral bands.
    
    * PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Identifying key hyperspectral bands for optimal mineral mapping.

2. Machine Learning-Based Clustering
   
    * Application of unsupervised clustering algorithms to hyperspectral data.
    
    * Identifying mineral clusters
    
    * Matching the results to band ratio method results and against spectral patterns from established spectral libraries.
